## Pre-interview Technical Challenge 
### **Repository push access will close after 11:59pm Jan 28**

* [A development challenge](#the-challenge)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

#### Extra credit
- include tests
- implement a search/filter for users to narrow down the results your app returns

### User Story

As a **user running the application**  
I can **view a list of restaurants**  
So that **I know which restaurants are currently available**

As a **user running the application**  
I can **view each restaurant listed individually**  
So that **I can view details about the restaurant**

## Technical questions

Please include answers to the following questions in your `APP_README.md` markdown file.

1. How long did you spend on this technical challenge? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
4-5 hrs. Would let the user search by city and I would also make application more user responsive. Lastly add a backend since and parse the data on the backend so the user can have their page load quicker.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
Of the ES8 features. Object.values is useful. 

```javascript
const obj = {foo:'bar',bar:'foo'}
    // I want the values for the this object
    const values = Object.values(obj)
    // I get an array of the values 
```
Not a language but a library, React. I really enjoy using Fragments new in react 16. 
```javascript
import React, { Fragment } from 'react'
const Header = () => (
  <Fragment>
  <h1>Test</h1>
  </Fragment>
)
// on the dom I would get only the h1. I believe if used correctly fragments will let us have much more readable doms and get out of div hell when not necessary. 
```

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
As a web developer my number one tool is chrome dev tools. The time-line tool lets you the fps on your page and you can even simulate a low-end device enviroment or slow internet speed.

4. How would you improve the Zomato API that you just used?
A lot of the restaurants are missing images. Would be nice if I could toggle for ones that only show images. The nearby feature with meters does not seem to work. It said I was in New Jersey when I put 5m. Allow for search location and query with natural language instead of ids.

5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
``` JSON
{
  "name":"Brian",
  "blood-type": "O-",
  "interest": ["programming","entrepreneurship","helping others"],
  "lovesToLearn": "true",
  "passionate": "true",

}
